# machine_learning
-- Based on provided information of passengers on the Titanic (from Kaggle), 
this project is aimed at conducting analysis of how these elements are related 
to being survived in the sinking or not, followed by evaluation with model built.
Three data files named “train.csv”, “test.csv”, and “gender_submission.csv” are given, 
representing training data, testing data and true results of testing data respectively. 
In test file, the survived data are removed and stored in the last file for prediction and 
accuracy calculation. Information of 1309 passengers is provided while 891 of them are training data.
For training data, 12 variables with 891 passengers need to be observed (as shown in Table I). 
In order to better model and predict, the feature will be classified and performed correlation examination. Missing value may be completed and categorical features may be converted to numeric values.
